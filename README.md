# PowerCraft 2.0

I solved some bugs, optimized code and added some new features.
Now it ported for 1.7.10 and will be released for newer versions someday.

### What modules are missing:
- Weasel (will be rewritten)
- CheckPoints (permanently removed)
- ItemStorage renamed to Storage

### First start:
- load the game
- Press P on your keyboard to open the PowerCraft Manager (Only in main menu)
- install modules,  
Core and API will be automatically installed on startup 

### Modules in Dev
- Logic (may contains bugs)
- Storage (may contains bugs)
- Mobile (may contains bugs)

### Planned:
- Integrations with industrials mods
- Add energy
- Write documentation for API
- Implement some ideas from abandoned sources (API / Modules repositories)
- Move from Eclipse to Intellij Idea

### TODO for release 0.1.1B:
- Fix errors in launcher
- Fix bugs in modules
- ~~Balancing craft recipes~~
- Replace temporary textures

All modules will be in the future added and fixes. 
You already can enjoy old powercraft on new version of Minecraft
